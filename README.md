hello everybody! 
Welcome to my forInterview Project! I'm Alfred Lee! 
According to the interview test, I am trying to build an AddressBook app that enables users to manage a simple contact list by adding,removing,and listing contacts. Users must be able to -- Create an account -- Log in -- Add a contact -- Remove a contact -- list all their contacts
I will use vscode+typescript+postgreSQL to build my project.
